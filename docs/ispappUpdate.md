# ispappUpdate.rsc Documentation

## Overview
The ispappUpdate.rsc script handles the update process for the ISPApp agent on MikroTik devices. It communicates with the update endpoint, processes received commands, and manages various update-related actions.

## Script Structure

1. Update Thread Check
2. Update Process Execution
3. Command Processing
4. Action Execution
5. Scheduler Adjustment

## Detailed Breakdown

### 1. Update Thread Check
- Checks if an update thread is already running to prevent multiple simultaneous updates.

### 2. Update Process Execution
- Calls the `sendUpdate` function to communicate with the update endpoint.
- Processes the response received from the server.

### 3. Command Processing
- If commands are received, it calls `submitCmds` and `executeCmds` functions to process them.

### 4. Action Execution
- Handles specific actions based on server response:
  - Executes speed test if requested.
  - Initiates firmware upgrade if pending.
  - Manages fast update mode.
  - Handles reboot requests.

### 5. Scheduler Adjustment
- Adjusts the intervals of ispappUpdate and ispappConfig schedulers based on the update mode.

## Key Functions

### sendUpdate
- Communicates with the update endpoint to receive update instructions.

### submitCmds, executeCmds
- Handle the submission and execution of commands received from the server.

### execActions
- Executes specific actions like speed tests, upgrades, or reboots.

## Error Handling and Logging
- Implements error logging for failed update processes.
- Provides feedback on the success or failure of the update process.

## Security Considerations
- Executes commands received from the server, emphasizing the need for secure and authenticated communication.

## Conclusion
The ispappUpdate.rsc script is essential for keeping the ISPApp agent up-to-date and responsive to server instructions. It manages the update process, executes received commands, and handles various system-level actions as directed by the ISPApp server.
